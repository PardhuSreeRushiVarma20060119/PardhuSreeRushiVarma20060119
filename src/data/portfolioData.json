            "Modern neural models are typically adapted through weight updates—procedures like fine-tuning or alignment that modify shared parameters. While effective for task performance, such updates can degrade reasoning, overwrite capabilities, and alter the model's functional identity. This is a structural limitation I term structural irreversibility.",
            "My research explores reversible adaptation frameworks that isolate learned behaviors from core model parameters. By externalizing adaptation into separable, removable components—treating them as governed runtime units—we enable deterministic rollback without identity loss. This approach prioritizes recoverability and structural robustness as first-class system properties.",
            "This work sits at the intersection of adversarial AI, systems security, and runtime-governed architectures. I aim to design intelligence systems that are not opaque artifacts, but structured, modular, and compositionally safe—capable of operating under adversarial conditions while maintaining transparent governance and deterministic control."
