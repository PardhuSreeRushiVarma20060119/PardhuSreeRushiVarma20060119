# Hi, I'm PardhuVarma!

I am a 3rd-year cybersecurity student with strong research interests in CyberSecurity, Adversarial AI, Systems Security Research, and Robust Machine Learning. My research focus involves understanding attacker–defender dynamics within intelligent systems and analyzing and constraining AI behavior under adversarial influence through runtime-governed architectures.

I explore areas such as adversarial ML attacks and defenses, cyber-physical threat modeling, robust learning architectures, and the reliability of AI-enabled systems in real-world settings. I’m particularly drawn to research at the intersection of AI, systems security, and cyber-physical infrastructures, reflecting a broader interest in designing intelligent, resilient security systems.

I aim to pursue advanced research at CISPA – Helmholtz Center for Information Security / Saarland University, and eventually a PhD or long-term research career in AI security and systems security research. My primary interests lie in trustworthy and robust machine learning, runtime-governed intelligent systems, and adversarial resilience, with particular motivation drawn from high-stakes domains such as cyber-physical infrastructures, autonomous systems, intelligent swarms, and next-generation defense architectures.

I am actively strengthening my academic foundation in AI, security, and systems engineering, and remain committed to advancing through rigorous study, research immersion, and scientifically grounded exploration.
