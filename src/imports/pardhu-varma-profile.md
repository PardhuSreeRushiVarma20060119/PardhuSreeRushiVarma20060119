Biography

I am a 3rd-year cybersecurity student with strong research interests in Adversarial AI, Cyber-Physical Systems, Systems Security Research, and Robust Machine Learning. My research focus involves understanding attacker–defender dynamics within intelligent systems and analyzing and constraining AI behavior under adversarial influence through runtime-governed architectures.

I explore areas such as adversarial ML attacks and defenses, cyber-physical threat modeling, robust learning architectures, and the reliability of AI-enabled systems in real-world settings. I’m particularly drawn to research at the intersection of AI, systems security, and cyber-physical infrastructures, reflecting a broader interest in designing intelligent, resilient security systems.

I aim to pursue advanced research at CISPA – Helmholtz Center for Information Security / Saarland University, and eventually a PhD or long-term research career in AI security and systems security research. My primary interests lie in trustworthy and robust machine learning, runtime-governed intelligent systems, and adversarial resilience, with particular motivation drawn from high-stakes domains such as cyber-physical infrastructures, autonomous systems, intelligent swarms, and next-generation defense architectures.

I am actively strengthening my academic foundation in AI, security, and systems engineering, and remain committed to advancing through rigorous study, research immersion, and scientifically grounded exploration.
