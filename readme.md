# *Hi, I'm PardhuVarma!* 
<p>
  <em>I‚Äôm a 3rd-year Computer Science student who spends way too much time pulling apart systems just to see how (and why) they fall apart. Cybersecurity and Adversarial AI are my playgrounds ‚Äî sometimes I build, sometimes I break, sometimes I do both in the same night.

Right now, I‚Äôm knee-deep in Rust, offensive security, and experiments with artificial intelligence that probably shouldn‚Äôt be running on my laptop at 3 AM‚Ä¶ but here we are. I see myself not just as ‚Äútechie", More like a Researcher fueled by caffeine, and the occasional existential crisis, chasing curiosity wherever it leads, even if the trail looks like borderline chaos.</em>
</p>

## What I‚Äôm Doing (-_-!)
- Experimenting with AI ‚Äî MARL, swarms, adversarial playbooks, endlessly pushing it to see what breaks and what freaks me out
- Building and prototyping in Golang and Rust, fueled by way too much caffeine and half-baked existential dread
- Orchestrating with Docker and K8s, breaking clusters just to fix them and wonder why I started
- Running hands-on research and infrastructure experiments while questioning every life choice and habit I‚Äôve ever had
- Grinding through CRTA and CRTID prep between chaos, coffee, and minor existential collapse
- Maintaining my own hell of repos ‚Äî messy, obsessive, occasionally brilliant, often abandoned for a day or two
- Cross-collaborating with peers on too many projects at once & occasionally forgetting that humans are supposed to eat, sleep, & breathe lol
- Creative madness powered by insomnia with caffeine, and a crisis that whispers ‚Äúwhy bruhhhhh?‚Äù at 3AM

## üí¨ How to Connect with Me
Wanna join me in caffeine-fueled chaos, AI experiments? or laugh at the existential horror of being alive?, drop a message. Peek at my repos, poke at projects, or just exist together ‚Äî I might reply before I spiral again.
